# Instagram Clone App

serhatgram is instagram clone app. Project includes Next.js, Next-auth, TailwindCss, Recoil, Firebase and more. I researched lot of project and inspired from them to do it, especially Sonny Sangha's project.  

## Functionality

1) User can authenticate his/her own account via Google Provider. (via Next-auth)
2) User can upload photo from his/her local.
3) User can make comment to posts.
4) User can likes the posts.


## Other Details

1) Faker.js is used to get fake users data in order to show in stories/recommendation sections.
2) HeadlessUI is used to style an animate modal screen.
3) Heroicons is used to get icons.
4) Recoil is used to set state of modal screen.


## Personal Notes

Using TailwindCSS in bigger project makes sense, I start to love TailwindCSS, easy-to-write and mobile friendly.

Recoil is used as basic level, but when i researched Recoil features and what it promises, I really like it and i think it will replace with Redux in a near future.

Next-auth is practical and safe.


## Important

When i tried to deploy the project to vercel, Tailwind is not working and I can't find any solution online. If you have an idea about problem, please let me know.
