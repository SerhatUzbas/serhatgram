## Personal Notes

Using TailwindCSS in bigger project makes sense, I start to love TailwindCSS, easy-to-write and mobile friendly.

Recoil is used as basic level, but when i researched Recoil features and what it promises, I really like it and i think it will replace with Redux in a near future.

Next-auth is practical and safe.


#### Important

When i tried to deploy the project to vercel, Tailwind is not working and I can't find any solution online. If you have an idea about problem, please let me know.
